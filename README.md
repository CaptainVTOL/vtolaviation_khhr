The latest airport developed by VTOL Aviation, and the first to feature custom assets, is KHHR Hawthorne Municipal Airport! Also known as Jack Northrop Field, 
HHR is a Class D airport nestled below the LAX Class B. HHR is overwhelmingly a General Aviation airport, with over 99% of the average 220 operations per day
fitting in the GA category. SpaceX is headquartered at the southeast end of the airport, lending striking visual landmarks such as a returns Falcon 9 Stage
1 booster and an outline of an X made of solar panels. Elon Musk's private plane is based here, and the northwest portion of the airport is home to Harrison
Ford's private hangar. The only year-round airline operating out of HHR is Advanced Air, who also operates the FBO, Jet Center Los Angeles. 

This airport is free to use and always will be, no matter what additional edits we make. If you use this airport in a stream or other creative media, all we 
ask is to receive credit for the airport. Please do NOT upload elsewhere without our permission. In order to ensure that people get the best quality freeware, 
we are handling releases in a very particular way to ensure that it's easiest for us to manage hotfixes. Custom assets developed for this airport may be used 
in other airports. However, credit to VTOL Aviation is required to be given.
